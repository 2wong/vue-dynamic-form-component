# Introduction

**VueDynamicFormComponent** is a form component base on [element-ui](https://element.faas.ele.me/#/zh-CN) and [async-validator](https://github.com/yiminghe/async-validator). You just need to write descriptors of the data you want, **VueDynamicFormComponent** will generate the form automatically.

## Features

- Generate form from **descriptors**
- Base data type support
- **Array** and **HashMap** support
- **Multi-Languages** support

## Todo

VueDynamicFormComponent can do more. There are a few things that it currently doesn't support but are planned:

- Multi-Select support
- Custom theme support
